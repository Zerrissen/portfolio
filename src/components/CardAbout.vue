                <p class="dark:text-gray-400 text-lg">Ever since I was little, I've been exposed to technology. Due to this,
                    I've had a strong advantage in comparison to my peers. I'm a self-taught developer working with Python, C#, Lua, and
                    JavaScript for my personal projects.</p>
                <br>
                <p class='dark:text-gray-400 text-lg'>Solving problems is a great satisfaction of mine, and I reflect this by running my own homelab to try both new and old technologies.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="dark:text-gray-400 text-lg">I have a strong interest in cybersecurity and digital forensics, so
                    have been competing in CTFs to keep myself in practice with cybersecurity techniques since 2021.</p>
                <br>
                <p class='dark:text-gray-400 text-lg'>Now that I'm studying network engineering, my pathways have started to open up for my career, and I'm excited to pursue opportunities related to security, digital forensics, or network administration.</p>
